## Clone the repository

If you want to contribute to ViewTube, I'd recommend you to fork the repository first. Otherwise, you can just clone it.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ViewTube/viewtube.git
```

## Run the development environment with docker

In order to run the server, you also need MongoDB and Redis. There is a docker-compose file supplied to run these locally. To use it, you need to have docker and docker-compose installed.

- Docker >20.x
- Docker-compose >2.x

Run the following command at the root of the project to start MongoDB and Redis

```bash
pnpm run serve:env
```

## Run it without docker

If you don't want to use docker, you need to install MongoDB and Redis separately.
ViewTube will automatically connect to the default ports of these services. If yours are different, check the [configuration](/configuration/environment) page on how to change them.

## Install dependencies

Run the following command at the root of the project to install all dependencies.

```bash
pnpm install
```

## Run the server and client

In order to run the server and client, you need to run the following commands in two separate terminals:

```bash
pnpm run serve:server
```

```bash
pnpm run serve:client
```

And the final step: <b>Visit [localhost:8066](http://localhost:8066) with a browser.</b>
