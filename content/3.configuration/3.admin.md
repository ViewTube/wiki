# Admin account

## Configure the admin
The admin account is disabled by default.  
In order to enable it, set the environment variable `VIEWTUBE_ADMIN_USER` to the username of the account to be used as admin. Afterwards, restart ViewTube.

::alert{type="warning"}
Set the environment variable only after you've created the account, otherwise anyone could create that account and receive administrative privileges.
