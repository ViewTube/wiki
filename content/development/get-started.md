# Get started with development

You can develop on basically any system that supports the [prerequisites](/development#prerequisites).
I personally develop on Windows and Linux. If you find that the development setup is not working for you, please [submit a pull request](https://github.com/ViewTube/viewtube). Unfortunately i don't have the time to test on every system. However, this documentation should be a pretty good starting point.

## Prerequisites

For development, you need the following tools installed.

- Node.js 20.11.x
- pnpm >=9.5.0

Of course, the basics like a text editor, git and a terminal are also required.
