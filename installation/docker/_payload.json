You will need to have   Docker  and   Docker Compose  installed.  Version overview  Latest   viewtube:latest  is the latest stable version. It should generally be safe to use. If you don't want to update automatically, you can use the version tag directly.\n    Dev   viewtube:dev  is the development version, which means it may contain bugs. However, it will receive fixes faster if YouTube changes something.\n    Setup  Environment variables   Check the   configuration page  for more information about the environment variables.
